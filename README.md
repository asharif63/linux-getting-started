linux-getting-started
=====================

A topic shared at open-cas addressing Linux Getting Started - Mainly about methodologies and practices along with shell scripting and makefile stuff.

A good starting point for understanding Linux can be found at [The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ 
Chapter 1 - Definitions and overview](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-basic_defs.en.html).

For understanding things under hood, I do recommend this lengthy and brilliant post [BSD vs Linux](http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/01).
